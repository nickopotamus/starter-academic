You’ve stumbled on the latest incarnation of my personal website, which hosts predominantly work related ramblings and the occasional badly written piece of amateurish open source code or bad statistical interpretation.

I’m an anaesthetics and intensive care speciality trainee in the East Midlands, with interests in retrieval and transfer medicine, neurointensive care, and motorsport medicine, and I dabble in research (currently completing a MSc in data science) and get quite nerdy about doing quality improvement well. 

If after all this you're desperate to contact me, [find me on any of the social media platforms, or send me an email](/#contact).
