I want to write a post about what happened when I got jabbed recently, but realise I can't without rationalising why I got jabbed. This is why you should too, as soon as you possibly can.

As with everything on this site - and the web in general - this is not medical advice, just here for information. If you have any questions aboute vaccination go speak to your doctor (and don't read crackpot conspiracy theories from people trying to sell you clicks)



## Basic immunology: Why COVID fucks you up

I am very much not an immunologist, but I do use a working knowledge of immunology in my day-to-day work life, so I'm going trying to try and make a complex topic relatively simple for the non-medic. In essense, you have two key immune systems:

1. *Innate immunity*: This is the army. It does one thing, and it does it well - massive deployment of resources aiming to kill all the things. Biologically this is passive things (like skin) and cells that are always do the same thing (macrophages, inflammation)
2. *Adaptive immunity*: This is the special forces of your immune system. Recognising known threats and discretely bumping them off without much fuss. This is where all the obsession with antibodies comes from.

Let's think about what happens when you catch an infection. As an adult (which I presume most of you reading this are) your immune system has seen most things. It's all about adaptive immunity - spotting the bug which we've met before, and zapping it with antibodies before it has a chance to do anything wrong. Taking our military analogy from above, this is the same as Border Control stopping a known bad guy on the way into the country, or MI6 quietly taking them out before you even know they're on the streets. Minimal interruption, and the world keeps turning. 

What about if you've never seen a bug before? Well that's a very different story for us, but it's one that kids live every single day. As a toddler you're constantly being exposed to new and exciting bacteria, viruses, and fungii, which is why they're constantly snotty, have a sore throad, hot, and grumpy. It's like the army is on the streets every day constantly fighting off new invaders, and the only way it knows how to copy is to throw lots and lots of soldiers at the problem (have a temperature, as a sign of a massive immune response) until it goes away. But it does mean that the slowly developing special forces now know that bad guy exists, and will be ready next time.

What do small children and bats have in common? They're really good at coping with this overwhelming immune response. This is why a lot of the horrid viruses (like [SARS-Cov-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it), the bug causing the disease COVID-19) [come from bats](https://theconversation.com/heres-how-scientists-know-the-coronavirus-came-from-bats-and-wasnt-made-in-a-lab-141850). They're like a developing country - so used to having the army on the streets that the population just go about their everyday lives and everything keeps happening the way it's supposed to.

![Baby bats. Cutest disease vectors.](/post/immunology-vaccine/baby_bats.jpeg)

As grown ups, we're far, far less adept at coping. Imagine the army being deployed on the streets of the UK? We can barely cope with rain, let alone the disruption that would cause. Things would grind to a halt and all the systems of government would fail. This is what happens when we get infected by a bug that we "should" have seen as a child - for example chickenpox in a kid causes an itchy rash, in an adult serious pneumonitis and death; I got glandular fever as an adult, which in kids causes a sore throat, but in adults (as I discovered) causes liver failure!

We're just not equipped to cope with this overwhelming immune response to new infections, and this is part of the underlying reason [why people die of sepsis](https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/what-is-sepsis.html) - the body's own responses to infection become dysfunctional, and we fall in a heap because we just can't cope.

And what's the newest infection on the block? Which none of us have seen? SARS-CoV-2...



## How COVID fucks you up

COVID-19 is very much a spectrum of disease, from mild infections through to respiratory failure and a sepsis-like picture that we still really don't understand, where this overwhelming inflammatory response knackers every your lungs, kidneys, heart, and brain, and makes your blood too prone to clotting. Trust me, you really don't want it.

Kids, on the whole, fair well with COVID. Adults do not, and the older we get, the less well we fair. This is all pretty much down to [our response to the innate immune system](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30135-8/fulltext). "I'm just doing my job" it'll cry, but kids are well made for the body's army to be going flinging it's biological missiles everywhere, and we're just not.

[Colin Angus](https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths) has put together some terrifying visualisations of how COVID is affecting the population by age groups, and this is excactly the picture we're seeing:

![Mortality is much worse in the older age groups](/post/immunology-vaccine/age_mortality.jpeg)

Hopefully by now you'll see that catching COVID would be a Bad Thing. Even if you've lucked out in the genetic lottery, and you can cope with an inflammatory response, that person you coughed on in the supermarket might not be so lucky, and your gran is in for a real struggle when her metaphorical army but in their first appearance for decades. So we all have a responsibility to try and stop catching this virus, both for our own sake, but also to stop spreading it around (and then we can all go back to doing the things we like, bonus win).


## Why the vaccine (probably) won't

Vaccines aim to work like that childhood phase, showing the body the potential bad guys at the door, and teaching the Special Forces to spot them. Almost all vaccines following this approach:

* Introduce a bit of dead bug, or an altered version of the bug that causes less harm
* Introduce some other things (called adjuvants) to irritate the immune system into responding
* Innate immunity gets excited (so you feel a bit generally unwell)
* Adaptive immunity makes some antibodies and it all goes away

Next time you see that bit of bug it will be attached to the bad version, but the adaptive immune response knows it, and kills it with antibodies before the army are even aware it exists, keeping you safe and happy (and before you can spread it around). Happy days.

Yes, there are risks with vaccines, but most of this risk is because you are playing with the immune system. For example, one of the most feared complications of measles is encephalitis (brain inflammation) due to the immune response. [This occurs in about 1-3 in 1000 infections](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html), so there is a very, very, *very* small risk of it happening with vaccines, because they're going for the same immune response. [It's happened three times in the entire history of measles vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr-vaccine.html), and in only one of them do they thing the vaccine was the cause. Similarly anti-vax websites rant about [transverse myelitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_myelitis) being causes by vaccines, but the [rate of it is vanishingly small](https://n.neurology.org/content/90/15_Supplement/P5.099) compared to the rate of transvere myelitis being caused by actual viruses.

Do we know these risks when we set out on a vaccine programme? Yes and no. Long-term risks are impossible to guarantee, but if we disproportionately worried about these we'd never vaccinate everyone. For example you can't know for sure the long term risks for a 'flu vaccine when it's [by necessity a new one every year](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/influenza-why-do-I-need-flu-vaccine-every-year-infographic.pdf), to cope with the evolution of 'flu, but we also know the "biologically plausible" risks of the things in the vaccine and of the bug we're injecting in to you and base our risk:benefits decision on that. We can't guarantee that you won't grow  a second head, but it's very, very biologically implausible as there's nothing in there known to cause it.

"But this is a new vaccine!" the masses shout hysterically. Lets see what the Pfizer vaccine does differently?

* Introduce a bit of code to make a bit of the virus
* Your cells make the bit of dead bug
* Everything above

Ok, bit of ```code```, that sounds _scary_. But it's not. You and I have DNA, the genetic code for making all the things our body needs to function (proteins). So do bugs (mostly). The way we turn DNA into proteins is by an intermediary, called RNA, which takes a short-lasting carbon copy of the DNA to little protein factories called ribosomes.

In the case of the vaccine, instead of trying to convince yeast cells to make bit of the virus which we can then purify and inject, or trying to engineer less harmful versions of SARS-CoV-2 to inject, we're skipping the middle man and injecting this RNA. Your own ribosomes will make this into an exact copy of the virus' protein - which on it's own can't do anything harmful - which your adaptive immunity will then recognise for next time it sees it attached to a virus.

If anything, this approach is *safer*. There's nothing biologically active being injected, and the RNA is broken down after a short while by the same mechanism that our cells use all the time to break down our own RNA. It can't go backwards into DNA, so you're not being genetically altered in any way, and there's no bugs in there to cause an infection.

(There's also no microchips)

Finally, there's all this concern that the vaccine is "rushed". It isn't.

SARS-Cov-2 might sound familiar. That's because it's a close relative to the OG [SARS virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome), so attempts to vaccinate against the "spike protein" (the bit that allows it to attach to our cells) have been going on for a while. The thing that holds up vaccine developments are 1) lack of political and financial will meaning paperwork and funding takes *ages* and 2) lack of the disease being around, so it takes years to get enough people exposed to say it works. None of these were a problem in this case. Governments around the world were prepared to cut red tape and [throw money at the problem](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html), you can catch the virus by going to the shops or catching the bus, and the underlying technology was already being developed and just needed tweaking.

The usual phase 3 trial (assessing how well a vaccine works) recruits a few hundred to a couple of thousand patients, and takes a few years, simply because it's really hard to ethically expose enough people to the illness to be sure it works. For example Ebola [recruited a few thousand people](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00002-1/fulltext). [The Pfizer vaccine recruited 43,661](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4552).

So no, this isn't rushed. It's off the shelf technology and excellent science being performed in a time of resources and political will, and to a bug that is freely available whereever you turn.

 
 ## Why you should get the vaccine as soon as you can
 
Hopefully this is helping you understand should get the vaccine (unless you can't, speak to your doctor). Protecting you, and protecting those around you.
 
* It isn't rushed
* It can't track you (and let's be honest, you're probably reading this on your mobile phone, and have at least one of a Google, Twitter, or Facebook account. Nobody needs to implant a microchip to track you because we all freely give our data anyway)
* The vaccine isn't just about you
* And COVID is a genuine problem

We'll return to Colin's plots for that last point: All cause morality is higher this year than in recent history. Not only is COVID (red) killing more peoplem than we'd like, the rammifications of this on the NHS is killing people from other things too (orange). We can't look after you if you get cancer, or crash your car, if [we have no beds](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) because they're all full of COVID.

![ALl cause mortality](/post/immunology-vaccine/all_cause_mortality.png)

So stay safe, keep everyone around you safe, and see you after we've all been vaccinated.
